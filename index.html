							<h2>Year of the Cicada</h2>
							<p>Year of the Cicada is a one-minute solo projection mapping piece in Kumler Chapel in Oxford, Ohio. This audio-reactive project was meticulously mapped to the chapel's arched architecture, combining visual storytelling with technical precision. Inspired by the 17-year hibernation cycle of cicadas, the piece reflects Stella’s personal connection to this natural phenomenon, being born on a year when the cicadas emerged. The work is both a technical showcase and a personal statement, blending light, sound, and narrative. This piece was illustrated in Procreate and later animated and lit in TouchDesigner. Year of the Cicada was also featured in 2025 on Autodesk's Instructables front page.</p>
